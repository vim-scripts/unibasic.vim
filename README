The UniVerse BASIC syntax file highlights the programming language used in IBM's UniVerse multivalue database application.  This file is extracted from Lubomir Husar's DataStage syntax file (vimscript #1310) and focuses on only the data related to UniVerse BASIC.  All the DataStage-specific items remain in the previous script.
